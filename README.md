# Atari CO60472 Delay Line Replacement
This small PCB is a replacement for the proprietary CO60472 Delay Line chip used in the Atari XL series of computers. It is based on schematics found on the AtariAge forums (https://atariage.com/forums/topic/253024-co60472-delay-line/#comments)

It works by using the propagation delays on a 74LS14 Hex Inverter with resistors and capacitors to get the right timings.
