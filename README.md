# Atari CO60472 Delay Line Replacement

# First Draft
This small PCB is a replacement for the proprietary CO60472 Delay Line chip used in the Atari XL series of computers. It is based on schematics found on the AtariAge forums (https://atariage.com/forums/topic/253024-co60472-delay-line/)

Installed in a 600XL:

The little board, once assembled, is piggybacked on top of a 74LS14 Hex Inverter.

# Billing of Materials:
- 1x 74LS14 or 74HC14 Hex Inverter Schmitt Trigger

Resistors:
- R1  : 120R Resistor, 0603
- R2  : 100R Resistor, 0603
- R3  : 120R Resistor, 0603
- R4  : 270R Resistor, 0603
- R5  : 620R Resistor, 0603

Capacitors:
- C1  : 1nF X7R Capacitor, 0603
- C2  : 150pF X7R Capacitor, 0603
- C3  : 30pF X7R Capacitor, 0603

Bend up pins 2,3,5,9,11 and 13, solder the little PCB on top of the 74LS14. Connect pins 1 and 7 to the PCB. 

# Rev. A
This is a rework of the first design. The functionality is still the same, for this design it is not necessary to bend up pins on the the IC and piggybacking the PCB on top of the IC. The IC can be soldered on top of the PCB, along with the resistors and capacitors. PCB thickness should be 0.6mm.

# Billing of Materials

Billing of materials is the same as the first design.

This is Rev. A installed in a 600XL, fits perfectly:
