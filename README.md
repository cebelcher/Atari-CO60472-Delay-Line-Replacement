The little board, once assembled, is piggybacked on top of a 74LS14 Hex Inverter.

# Billing of Materials:
- 1x 74LS14 Hex Inverter Schmitt Trigger

Resistors:
- R1  : 120R Resistor, 0603
- R2  : 100R Resistor, 0603
- R3  : 120R Resistor, 0603
- R4  : 270R Resistor, 0603
- R5  : 620R Resistor, 0603
